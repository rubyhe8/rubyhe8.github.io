can go back to [homepage](index.html).

interactivity is great!

Here's the tidyverse.
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

library(p8105.datasets)
```

load the airbnb dataset 
```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    rating = review_scores_location / 2
  ) |> 
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, room_type, lat, long
  ) |> 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price <= 500,
    price >= 100
  )
```

let's make a scatterplot, but interactive this time  
```{r}
nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating) 
  ) |> 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price,
    text = ~label,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.5
  )
```
