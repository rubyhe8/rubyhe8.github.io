Hello! My name is Ruby and I am a 2nd Year MPH Student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. 

Some of my research interests include aging, risk factors for cognitive decline, pharmacoepidemiology, access to care, and health disparities. 

In my free time I enjoy being a foodie (I love recipe testing!!), touching grass, and reading. (I am currently reading Jonathan Haidt's *The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness*)
