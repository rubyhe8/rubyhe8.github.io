we often make plots in data science. 

Here's the tidyverse.
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here's the dataframe. 

```{r}
plot_df =
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 2),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(100)
  )
```

Here's the plot 

```{r}
plot_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x= x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
